We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details
when appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to
construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a ``mix and match'' way. We control
complexity by establishing new languages for describing a design, each of which emphasizes particular
aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.
