# #2 Interfaces

This note will be about _interfaces_.
No need to be a programmer to know about interfaces.
They are everywhere in our life. 
Right now you might be using many.
And right now you are thinking "hey! you _chavacava_, you did not yet define what you exactly mean by _interface_".
You are right, interfaces are so many things (your computer keyboard, an USB port, the electricity plug, the screen you are looking at, the REST endpoint that served this page, ...), but as you suspect, I will talk (write in fact!) about interfaces in programming languages.
Yes, these interfaces that you usually declare with an `interface` keyword.

The role of interfaces is to let us build and use _abstractions_.
You can say that interfaces are not specials because, at the end, all this _computer programming_ stuff is about building and using abstractions.
You are not wrong. 
Programming is about building, the right, abstractions that allows us master the complexity of the problem we are solving.

I'm not saying something new.

We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details
when appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to
construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a ``mix and match'' way. We control
complexity by establishing new languages for describing a design, each of which emphasizes particular
aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.
